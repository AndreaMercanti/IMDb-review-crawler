Before anything, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. You can either use a pre-set virtual environment as
anaconda, or set a new one in the folder where you're going to clone the repo.

To set a new virtual environment, install python, if not already, and then run these in the shell/terminal:

`pip install virtualenv`

`virtualenv venv`

## Activate the virtual environment
### on Linux
`source ./venv/bin/activate`
### on Windows
`.\venv\Scripts\activate`

## Install the needed modules
`pip install scrapy`
